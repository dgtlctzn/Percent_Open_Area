# Percent Open Area
A test method to determine the percent open area of a geotextile

At the geophysical testing lab I work for there is a test called Percent Open Area. POA is a materials testing method to determine the open area of woven geotextiles. I wrote a function that takes the file name and intensity threshold as arguments and returns the POA percentage. This is a major improvement on the previous approach of calculating each open area percentage by hand.
